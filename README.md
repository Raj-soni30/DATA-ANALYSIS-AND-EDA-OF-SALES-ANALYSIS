# SALES DATA ANALYSIS  AND EDA 

This project involves a comprehensive sales analysis, incorporating exploratory data analysis (EDA) and actionable recommendations. By cleaning and preparing the dataset, key metrics such as total sales, average order value, and sales distribution were examined across different regions and product categories. The analysis revealed seasonal trends, peak sales periods, and customer segmentation, identifying high-value customers and their purchasing behaviors. Key recommendations include optimizing stock levels for high-demand products, targeting marketing efforts during peak sales periods, and focusing on customer retention strategies. This project provides valuable insights for enhancing sales performance, improving customer satisfaction, and driving business growth through data-driven decision-making.
